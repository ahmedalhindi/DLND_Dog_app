# DLND_Dog_app
My attempt at Udacity's DLND Dog app project

A fun little deep learning project that is made up of a few sections:
1- compares Haar cascade classifier to CNNs.
2- looks at cnn network made from scratch as well as transfer learned network
3- example images are tested against trained model
